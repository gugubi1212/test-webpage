Servus! This is my first webproject where you can add/delete/display contributes in a database.

## Getting Started

In order to open the website, try running the following in the terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
